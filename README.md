# CapstoneJavaFinalProject
This project is a set of Machine Learning models that predict whether or not a client will default on a loan based on 9 factors: Amount of the loan requested, Amount due on their current mortgage, Value of their current property, Reason for their loan (Most are home improvement), Job, Number of years present at their current job, Number of major derogatory reports, Number of delinquent credit lines, and Age of oldest trade line in months. 

Testing and diagrams for the model are in the Jupyter notebook (ipynb) file. The .csv file is cleaned data that has all been converted to numbers. The original dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/ajay1735/hmeq-data. 

As for libraries for this project, I was using Python 3.8.12, and had the pandas, sci-kit learn, and seaborn libraries installed.
